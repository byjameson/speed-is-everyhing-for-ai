Philosophy has a huge field in the field of artificial intelligence. 
Mastering the philosophy of the job is the only way to do the job right.
First of all, imagine that you have created an artificial intelligence and this artificial intelligence predicts what will happen in 10 seconds.
Isn't this perfect?
But if he can predict what will happen 10 seconds later, 20 seconds later, then he will have predicted 10 seconds before and it will be useless.

Today we will focus on this situation. In artificial intelligence, you need to be able to use your machine at the highest level so that you can get full efficiency. Using the least common multiple method is the most logical method here.

For example, there are 10 names in our mysql table. We can increase this to maximum efficiency by using the common multiple logic and calculating the closest multipliers. The main logic is that we will have 2 numbers and the product of these numbers will give 10 and these numbers will be as close to each other as possible.

For 10 names, 2 and 5 are the most suitable numbers. are the numbers whose product is 10 and whose sum is the lowest due to their closeness.

Now, one of these numbers is our table number and the other is the data numbers that will be in the tables.
It's up to you which one you choose here, it won't matter which one you choose.

For example, let's make 5 tables and enter 2 names, of course, these names will not be entered randomly, they will be entered according to a certain ordering rule, and the data should be classified here.

For example, let our 2 names start with the letter a and let's call this table a
Let the other two names start with b and let's call the table b, so let's do c d as well. Let's assume that our data is suitable for this, much larger data will require larger classifications.

Now we choose the table we will choose first and we choose one of 5, then we choose one of the 2 variables inside, and in the worst case, 7 operations are done, even if all our options are at the very end.
How many transactions would we have done if we had never done this? 10! You may not understand the difference well here.
If our data were 100, we could divide it into 10 by 10 and finish by doing 20 operations for 100 operations.
As you can see, it provides an incredible speed gain, so if you use the method that creates your data structure accordingly, you can predict 10 seconds later, 9 seconds ahead :)
